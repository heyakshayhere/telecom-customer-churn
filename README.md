# telecom-customer-churn
Customers in the telecom industry can choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. The telecommunications industry has an annual churn rate of 15-25%. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies must predict which customers are likely to leave. This project is centred on the Indian and Southeast Asian markets.
